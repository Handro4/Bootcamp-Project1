### 1. Does gender affect pricing?

### 3. What trends can be discovered by analyzing the age of patients across the dataset?
   In the healthcare world a patient’s age can be used to make a large number of predictions. Knowing a patient’s age can assist healthcare professionals in a number of ways including medical diagnosis, provided treatment, and estimated recovery time. We wanted to analyze the information based on a patient’s age to see if we could uncover trends to help inform decisions. 

* To start our analysis of this question we created bins for the various age ranges we wanted to analyze. The bins we chose for our analysis were 18-30, 30-45, 45-60, 60-75, 75-90. We chose those age ranges because our dataset didn't have any records for patients less than 18 and greater than 90 years old. Once we added these bins to our dataframe we performed a quick analysis
